## My process
I went with a desktop-first approach, as this was my first time working with responsiveness.
After drawing on paper the box models to see how to structure the HTML, I moved onto contructing piece by piece the SMACSS.
The first design was made using floats, later on changed to flex for learning purposes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS/Sass
- Desktop-first workflow
- SMACSS Methodology

### What I learned

- How sass files are put together and how to pick and change their post-process css styles
- How to approach building a website from a given design
- How to leverage on containers backgrounds to change images depending on the viewport 

### Continued development

- Learning how to better scale fonts and maintain the designs across different screen-ratios.
